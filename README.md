>The Return to Slumber Page below has a dynamic active moving background, but isn't really a page any one should go to because that means they chose the blue pill which would be choosing not to learn and remain oblivious, aka asleep. So, Wake Up.

About Fight4Privacy (Rebuild)

Fight4Privacy is an educational resource designed to help individuals, especially those at high risk, recognize and protect themselves from online threats such as scams and identity theft. My goal is to make this content straightforward and easy to understand—especially for the elderly, who are often targeted by a variety of scams.

Why This Matters:

Online privacy and security are under constant threat. Personally, I receive frequent notices from companies admitting that their systems were compromised, and my data may have been exposed. This "invisible battle" affects all of us, often without us realizing it until it's too late. Once your personal information is stolen, piecing your life back together can be an uphill battle, sometimes with tragic consequences.

Many people don’t think it can happen to them—until it does. This site is a reminder that taking even small, free steps to protect yourself online is vital. Awareness and action now can prevent disaster later.

A Fresh Start:

This is a rebuild of my previous project, which broke and grew beyond what I could manage. Rather than abandoning it, I decided to start from scratch and keep it simple. 
Fight4Privacy will serve as a showcase of my work, as well as a tool to educate and protect.
