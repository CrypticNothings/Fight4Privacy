        <p>You think you’re safe. Behind your screen, behind your keyboard. But in the digital world, safety is nothing more than an illusion. Right now, as you’re reading this, you’ve already made yourself vulnerable. In fact, you may have already been compromised.

            Look around. Does everything seem normal? Are you sure? The site you're on, the address bar, even the text you're reading—what if none of it is what it seems? What if, without you knowing, a single line of code has changed what you’re seeing, leading you into a carefully crafted trap?
            
            You clicked a link to get here. Harmless, right? But what if that one click gave someone access to your information, your browsing habits, even your personal details? You wouldn’t know until it was too late.

Maybe a letter changed, maybe it’s an entirely different site—but you wouldn’t notice. Not until everything started to fall apart. And by then, your privacy would be in someone else’s hands. They wouldn’t even need to be particularly skilled—just patient, waiting for you to let your guard down.
            
            Now the real question: What’s happening right now, as you read this? Is this really the site you thought you’d come to? Or have you already stepped into something far more dangerous than you ever imagined?
            
            The frightening reality is that technology and AI have blurred the line between real and fake. In an instant, a trusted website can become a tool to steal everything from you, without you even knowing it. The risks aren’t just hypothetical—they’re already here, and they’re closer than you think.

            As you’ve been reading, a single doubt has crept into your mind. That’s all it takes. Cybercriminals exploit this doubt, this uncertainty, to manipulate and trick you. Every seemingly innocent click, every “safe” site, can be a gateway to a devastating breach of your privacy. 
        </br>
    </br>
What you just experienced is a subtle example of a phishing or spoofing attack—where something you trust is manipulated to deceive you. This type of attack is one of the most common ways cybercriminals trick individuals into giving away personal information. The website, the link, the email—everything can look legitimate until it’s too late.

            <li><b>Fake tech support</b></li>
              <ul>a type of scam in which a scammer claims to offer a legitimate technical support service. Victims contact scammers in a variety of ways, often through fake pop-ups resembling error messages or via fake "help lines" advertised on websites owned by the scammers. Technical support scammers use social engineering and a variety of confidence tricks to persuade their victim of the presence of problems on their computer or mobile device, such as a malware infection, when there are no issues with the victim's device. The scammer will then persuade the victim to pay to fix the fictitious "problems" that they claim to have found. Payment is made to the scammer via gift cards, which are hard to trace and have few consumer protections in place.

                You might receive a text message telling you that you have a package or delivery pending, and you need to confirm your identity or pay a fee to claim ownership.

                You might receive a message purporting to be from your bank, telling you that your account is being closed, or your debit card is being locked or charged, and to log in (to a fake website) to prevent that from happening.
            </br>
        </br>
                Or perhaps the message tells you that you’ve won a huge prize, and to claim it, you need to submit your financial information.

            <li><b>Social Media</b></li>
             <ul>
                You might see a social media quiz that promises to tell you what personality type you are, or what celebrity you look like, or offers you an eye-catching prize. They usually include terms and conditions which allow the data you enter to be sold to third parties. The quiz developer can also obtain a lot of information about you from your profile, friends list, and IP address – which can be used to build up a picture as part of identity theft.
             </br>
            </br>
                Or perhaps you receive a random friend request on Instagram from a fraudster posing as someone you may know, who then sends you a phishing link that takes you to a malicious site.
            </br>
        </br>
                Perhaps you download an app on social media which you think is legitimate, but in fact downloads malware onto your device.

            <li><b>Online Shopping Scam</b></li>
              <ul>Scammers use the latest technology to set up fake retailer websites that look like genuine online stores, using stolen logos and copied designs. Many of these websites offer popular brands of clothing or jewelry, or gadgets at low prices. Sometimes you may receive the item you’ve paid for, but often you don't. A more recent version of the scam involves setting up a social media store, which usually disappears after a while to resurface again in another guise.
