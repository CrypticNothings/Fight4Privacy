        <h2>Risks Intro</h2>
        <p>You think you’re safe. Behind your screen, behind your keyboard. But in the digital world, safety is nothing more than an illusion. Right now, as you’re reading this, you’ve already made yourself vulnerable. In fact, you may have already been compromised.

            Look around. Does everything seem normal? Are you sure? The site you're on, the address bar, even the text you're reading—what if none of it is what it seems? What if, without you knowing, a single line of code has changed what you’re seeing, leading you into a carefully crafted trap?
            
            You clicked a link to get here. Harmless, right? But what if that one click gave someone access to your information, your browsing habits, even your personal details? You wouldn’t know until it was too late.
            
        </br><center><i>Take a closer look.</i></center></br> Does the URL look slightly off? Maybe a letter changed, maybe it’s an entirely different site—but you wouldn’t notice. Not until everything started to fall apart. And by then, your privacy would be in someone else’s hands. They wouldn’t even need to be particularly skilled—just patient, waiting for you to let your guard down.
            
            Now the real question: What’s happening right now, as you read this? Is this really the site you thought you’d come to? Or have you already stepped into something far more dangerous than you ever imagined?
            
            The frightening reality is that technology and AI have blurred the line between real and fake. In an instant, a trusted website can become a tool to steal everything from you, without you even knowing it. The risks aren’t just hypothetical—they’re already here, and they’re closer than you think.

            <center><b>The Reveal:</b></center>
        </br>
            As you’ve been reading, a single doubt has crept into your mind. That’s all it takes. Cybercriminals exploit this doubt, this uncertainty, to manipulate and trick you. Every seemingly innocent click, every “safe” site, can be a gateway to a devastating breach of your privacy. 
        </br>
    </br>
What you just experienced is a subtle example of a phishing or spoofing attack—where something you trust is manipulated to deceive you. This type of attack is one of the most common ways cybercriminals trick individuals into giving away personal information. The website, the link, the email—everything can look legitimate until it’s too late.
